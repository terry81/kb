<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>A deadlock is a situation in computer programming where two or more processes are blocked, each waiting for the other to release a resource that they need in order to continue executing. As a result, all the processes remain blocked indefinitely and are unable to make further progress.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>In the context of multithreading, a deadlock occurs when two or more threads are blocked, each waiting for a resource held by the other. This leads to a situation where all threads are blocked and unable to make progress, effectively halting the program.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Deadlocks can occur due to improper synchronization of resources or when locks are acquired in the wrong order. </p>

<p>Here is an example:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:code --></p>
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>class DeadlockExample {
  static Object lock1 = new Object();
  static Object lock2 = new Object();

  static class Thread1 implements Runnable {
    public void run() {
      synchronized (lock1) {
        System.out.println("Thread 1: Holding lock 1...");
        try {
          Thread.sleep(10);
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
          e.printStackTrace();
        }
        System.out.println("Thread 1: Waiting for lock 2...");
        synchronized (lock2) {
          System.out.println("Thread 1: Holding lock 1 &amp; 2...");
        }
      }
    }
  }

  static class Thread2 implements Runnable {
    public void run() {
      synchronized (lock2) {
        System.out.println("Thread 2: Holding lock 2...");
        try {
          Thread.sleep(10);
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
          e.printStackTrace();
        }
        System.out.println("Thread 2: Waiting for lock 1...");
        synchronized (lock1) {
          System.out.println("Thread 2: Holding lock 1 &amp; 2...");
        }
      }
    }
  }

  public static void main(String&#91;] args) {
    Thread t1 = new Thread(new Thread1());
    Thread t2 = new Thread(new Thread2());
    t1.start();
    t2.start();
  }
}</code></pre>

<p>The <code>DeadlockExample</code> class defines two static objects, <code>lock1</code> and <code>lock2</code>, which will be used as the locks for the two threads.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>There are two inner classes, <code>Thread1</code> and <code>Thread2</code>, which implement the <code>Runnable</code> interface and define the <code>run</code> method that will be executed by the threads.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>In the <code>run</code> method of <code>Thread1</code>, the thread first acquires the lock on <code>lock1</code> using the <code>synchronized</code> keyword, and then prints a message indicating that it's holding the lock. It then waits for a short time using <code>Thread.sleep(10)</code>. After the sleep, it tries to acquire the lock on <code>lock2</code> and prints a message indicating that it's holding both locks.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Similarly, in the <code>run</code> method of <code>Thread2</code>, the thread first acquires the lock on <code>lock2</code> using the <code>synchronized</code> keyword, and then prints a message indicating that it's holding the lock. It then waits for a short time using <code>Thread.sleep(10)</code>. After the sleep, it tries to acquire the lock on <code>lock1</code> and prints a message indicating that it's holding both locks.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>In the <code>main</code> method, two threads are created, one for each of the <code>Thread1</code> and <code>Thread2</code> classes, and they are started using the <code>start</code> method.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Since both threads are trying to acquire both locks in different orders, there is a chance that one of the threads will hold <code>lock1</code> while the other is waiting for it, and the other will hold <code>lock2</code> while the first is waiting for it. This leads to a deadlock situation, where both threads are stuck and unable to proceed, because each is waiting for the other to release the lock they need.</p>
