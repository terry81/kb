<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Retry logic can be implemented in Java using various libraries and frameworks, but the general idea is to have a block of code that can potentially fail, and then wrap that code in a loop that will retry the code execution a certain number of times until either the code succeeds or the maximum number of retries has been reached. Here is an example implementation of a retry logic in Java:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:code --></p>
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>public class RetryLogicExample {

    public static void main(String&#91;] args) {
        int maxRetries = 3;
        int retryCount = 0;

        while (retryCount &lt; maxRetries) {
            try {
                // Call the code that can potentially fail
                someFunction();
                // If the code succeeds, break out of the loop
                break;
            } catch (Exception e) {
                // If the code fails, increment the retry count
                retryCount++;
                if (retryCount == maxRetries) {
                    // If the maximum number of retries has been reached, re-throw the exception
                    throw e;
                } else {
                    // If there are still retries left, wait for a short period of time before trying again
                    Thread.sleep(1000);
                }
            }
        }
    }

    public static void someFunction() throws Exception {
        // Some code that can potentially fail
        // ...
        // If the code fails, throw an exception
        throw new Exception("Some error occurred");
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p><!-- /wp:code --></p>

<p>In this example, the <code>someFunction()</code> method represents the code that can potentially fail. The <code>main()</code> method contains the retry logic, which loops over the call to <code>someFunction()</code> until it either succeeds or the maximum number of retries has been reached. If the code fails, the <code>catch</code> block increments the retry count and either re-throws the exception if the maximum number of retries has been reached or waits for a short period of time before trying again.</p>

<p>Furthermore, there are several libraries available in Java that can be used to implement retry logic with different features and capabilities. Here are some of the popular libraries for implementing retry logic in Java:</p>

<li><strong><a href="https://failsafe.dev/">Failsafe</a></strong>: A lightweight and easy-to-use library that provides a fluent API for defining retry behavior. It supports different retry strategies, such as exponential backoff, jitter, and circuit breaking, and also allows you to define fallback actions.</li>
