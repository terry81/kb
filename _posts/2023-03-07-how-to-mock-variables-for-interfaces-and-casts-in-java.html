<p>One common issue when writing JUnit tests is how to create a mock when the variable is an an interface / implementation or a casting.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>For example, in the case of casting:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:code --></p>
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>public PaymentGateway {
    void refund(SomePaymentProcessor processor);
    processor = new PaymentProcessorImpl(); //concrete implementation
    processor = (SomeOtherProcessor) processor; //casting
}</code></pre>
<p><!-- /wp:code --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The variable processor is casted to SomeOtherProcessor. That's why when you create a mock with it, you have to cover both SomePaymentProcessor and SomeOtherProcessor like this:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:code --></p>
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>processor = mock(SomePaymentProcessor.class, withSettings().extraInterfaces(PaymentProcessorImpl.class, SomeOtherProcessor.class));
</code></pre>
<p><!-- /wp:code --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>To add the extra classes PaymentProcessorImpl and SomeOtherProcessor we have used the additional Mockitor method <code>withSettings().extraInterfaces()</code>. In Java, <code>withSettings().extraInterfaces()</code> is a method that is used in conjunction with the Mockito library. This method allows you to specify additional interfaces that you want to mock along with the class you are mocking.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>In summary, you would use <code>withSettings().extraInterfaces()</code> when you want to mock an object that implements multiple interfaces, and you want to specify all of these interfaces when creating the mock object.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
