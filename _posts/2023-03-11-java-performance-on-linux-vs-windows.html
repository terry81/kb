<p>Java is a cross-platform language, which means that Java applications can run on a variety of operating systems, including Linux and Windows. The performance of Java applications can depend on a variety of factors, including the specific implementation, the hardware and software environment, and the workload of the application.</p>

<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>In general, Java applications tend to perform better on Linux than on Windows. This is because Linux is generally considered to be a more lightweight and efficient operating system than Windows. Linux has a smaller memory footprint and requires fewer system resources than Windows, which can result in better performance for Java applications.</p>

<p>Additionally, Linux is often preferred for server environments due to its stability and security features, which can help ensure the reliability and security of Java applications running on Linux servers.</p>

<p>That being said, the performance of Java applications can vary depending on the specific use case and implementation, so it's important to evaluate each on a case-by-case basis. Factors such as hardware configuration, JVM settings, and application design can all have a significant impact on the performance of Java applications.</p>

<p>If you wonder which Linux to choose, there are many different Linux distributions (or "distros") available, and the choice of which one to use for Java development can depend on a variety of factors, including personal preference, familiarity, and the specific requirements of the project. That being said, there are some Linux distros that are well-suited for Java development and are commonly used by Java developers.</p>

<p>One popular Linux distro for Java development is Ubuntu. <a href="https://ubuntu.com/download/server">Ubuntu's server flaviour </a>is a user-friendly Linux distro that is easy to install and configure, and it has a large community of developers and users that provide support and resources. Ubuntu also includes the OpenJDK (Java Development Kit) in its official repositories, making it easy to install and use Java.</p>
