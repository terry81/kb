<p>One of the fastest ways to advance in Java programming is using SolarLint's IDE extension. It helps you avoid common problems and ensures your code is clean.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>SonarLint is a linting tool for code quality analysis and improvement. It is a plugin for various Integrated Development Environments (IDEs), including Eclipse, IntelliJ, and Visual Studio, that helps developers write better code by detecting and fixing bugs, vulnerabilities, and code smells in real-time, while they are writing code.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>SonarLint is designed to work seamlessly within the developer's IDE, providing inline notifications and suggestions for code improvement as the developer writes. The tool is based on the same quality rules as SonarQube, a popular open-source platform for continuous code inspection, and is configured to use the same set of rules and standards as the central SonarQube server.</p>
