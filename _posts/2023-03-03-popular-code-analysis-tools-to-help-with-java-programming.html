<p>Code analysis tools are software tools that analyze source code for potential issues, errors, and vulnerabilities. These tools can help developers identify and fix issues before they become problems, and can improve the overall quality and security of their code.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Code analysis tools work by analyzing the source code of a program, looking for potential issues such as syntax errors, performance bottlenecks, security vulnerabilities, and other issues that can impact the quality of the code. Some code analysis tools perform static analysis, which means they analyze the code without actually running it, while others perform dynamic analysis, which means they analyze the code as it runs.</p>

<p>Code analysis tools can be used for a wide range of purposes, including:</p>
