# About Us

Welcome to the Basement of Knowledge!

This is a site where you can find technical articles on programming (mostly Java related), Linux and Windows topics. Everything from simple web-middleware related how-tos to some coding examples.

Who am I? I’ve been writing technical articles for XY years... only if some of my teachers could have imagined that... 

You may find some of the code imperfect, but let me quote use a quote from the book Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code:

There’s nothing wrong with a quick and dirty simple program.

If you want to contact me, send me an email at tollodim at google's mail.
